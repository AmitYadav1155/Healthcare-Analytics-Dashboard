## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I’m Amit Yadav, a self-motivated learner transitioning from a software development background (Laravel) into Data Analysis.

In this project, I applied newly learned skills in Power BI, Excel, and data storytelling to solve a real-world scenario in healthcare analytics.  
It helped me understand how to extract meaningful insights from raw data that can support better decision-making.

This dashboard is part of my ongoing journey to become a well-rounded Data Analyst, and I’m excited to apply these skills to real industry problems.  
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
